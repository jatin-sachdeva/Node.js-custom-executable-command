Major steps involved in constructing the application:

**STEP2** : initialise a node project using npm init --y (flag denotes default settings)

-(that should be used as executable command) in the bin property in package.json
- the key will be command name and value will be the file to be executed

**STEP4** :  link our project so that the .js file set as executable can be run globally across
-- any directory

 **STEP5** : using parralal chained promises and methods of FS to descriminate the fiiles
-- and folders

**STEP6** : color coding the console log using 'chalk module'
